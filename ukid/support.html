        <h3>2. How We Use Data</h3>
        <p>- Your photos are used <strong>only</strong> to generate compliant passport/ID images on your device.</p>
        <p>- We do not use your data for advertising, analytics, or tracking.</p>

        <h3>3. Data Sharing</h3>
        <p>- We do not share your personal information with any third parties.</p>
